# Z8T
A Z80 assembler, disassembler, and emulator.

And maybe eventually RTL as well.

### TODO : Most of everything
- Assembler is in progress.
- Disassembler is not started.
- Emulator is not started.

## Requirements 
- Catch2 (included)
- gcc/clang with C++17 support. Even so, there aren't many features used here that should require more than C++11, but I build with `-std=c++17`.
